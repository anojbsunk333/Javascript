// JavaScript Logical Operators 

/*Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine boolean expressions.

Logical operators can be used to modify the results of comparisons.

Typically, you will use a comparison operator to check a condition, and a logical operator to combine conditions into more complex logic.*/

        // Example: 
let x = 6;
let y = 3;
let z = (x < 10 && y > 1)
