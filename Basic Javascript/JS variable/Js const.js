/*Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared
Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned

const cannot be reassigned */


 /* When to use Javascript Const? 
Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed
Use const when you declare:
1. A new Array
2. A new Object
3. A new Function
4. A new RegExp */

/*It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:

Change the elements of constant array
Change the properties of constant object */
